# Password Generator
The aim of this application is to provide passwords generated randomly. It is easy to use thanks to its simple user interface that contains intuitive buttons and switches.

As soon as the app is opened, a new password is already generated. Using the refresh button it is possible to generate another one and, thanks to the switches, it is possible to add numbers and special characters while thanks to the seekbar it is possible to increase its length.

It is also possible to see how strong the password is and how difficult to guess thanks to a simple algorithm (not very accurate) that can calculate a value from 0 to 10 and display it on the progressbar.

It is also possible to insert one of our passwords in the editText to see how strong it is.

Furthermore, in the section below there are two buttons that allow us to copy our newly created password to the clipboard and to find, thanks to the API provided by the site https://haveibeenpwned.com/, how many times this password has been found and forced to access some website.
